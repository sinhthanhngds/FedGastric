The application of deep learning techniques in medical imaging has garnered significant attention due to their ability to detect and classify abnormalities with high accuracy. Numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of various convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques in diagnosing diseases, including gastric cancer (GC), often surpassing the performance of human diagnosticians. For example, @hirasawaApplicationArtificialIntelligence2018a utilised a Single Shot MultiBox Detector CNN diagnostic system, which successfully detected 98.6% of lesions with a diameter of at least 6 mm. The missed cases were identified as specific edge cases, emphasising the system's overall robustness. Similarly, @ikenoyamaDetectingEarlyGastric2021 employed an Inception-v3 CNN, which detected early gastric cancer (EGC) cases more rapidly than endoscopists, and @tangDevelopmentValidationRealtime2020 applied a Darknet-53 CNN, which not only outperformed endoscopists in diagnostic accuracy but also significantly enhanced clinicians' diagnostic capabilities. 

In the context of this proposal, several studies have explored the application of deep learning models trained on histopathological images to support the diagnostic process. @yoshidaAutomatedHistologicalClassification2018 investigated the use of e-Pathologist, the first automated image analysis software, which demonstrated promising potential for aiding gastric cancer diagnosis after further enhancements to its screening capabilities. Building on this, @songClinicallyApplicableHistopathological2020 developed an AI system that assisted pathologists by analysing gastric histopathology images, flagging slides for re-examination or additional testing. The study's results indicated that the model not only functioned as a pre-analytical tool that can help prioritize cases but also as a second opinion system, particularly in challenging cases.  

A systematic review by @klangDeepLearningGastric2023 on the application of deep learning to GC detection further reinforced the success of AI systems in improving diagnostic accuracy and segmentation. However, the review identified key challenges in ensuring robust model performance across diverse populations and imaging conditions, which require larger and more varied datasets. Issues around the validation and standardization of AI models also emerged as critical barriers to clinical adoption. The authors noted, however, that the limitations of the reviewed studies may have compounded these challenges, especially on the fact that majority of the papers reviewed were conducted in single-centre settings. 

In response to these data availability and privacy concerns, @dengArtificialIntelligenceApplications2022 proposed federated learning (FL) as a solution. FL allows multiple institutions to collaborate on model training without sharing sensitive patient data, addressing concerns related to data privacy and security while promoting model validation and standardization. @shellerFederatedLearningMedicine2020 compared FL to other collaborative learning approaches, such as Institutional Incremental Learning (IIL) and Cyclic Institutional Incremental Learning (CIIL), finding that FL yielded the best results in terms of rate of model improvement over the set learning method epoch and the development of better-performing models on average. 

An in-depth application of FL was explored by @fengRobustlyFederatedLearning2024a, who developed a customized FL model for identifying high-risk patients with postoperative gastric cancer recurrence. The model reportedly enhanced local hospital models and improved the detection local algorithmâ€™s performance when applied to a separate public lung cancer dataset. Nevertheless, the peer review of the study has raised methodological concerns, including the identification of regions of interest (ROI), sample sizes, and the privacy protection of generated data. 

Other FL projects have also shown promise in improving diagnostic imaging and, by extension, patient outcomes. @patiFederatedLearningEnables2022b successfully employed FL in the diagnosis of common and fatal brain tumours, demonstrating positive contributions to the final consensus model's performance. Similarly, @almufarehFederatedLearningApproach2023 noted significant improvements in breast cancer diagnosis through FL, which consolidated data from multiple healthcare institutions without compromising patient privacy. @luFederatedLearningComputational2020a utilized federated learning to effectively develop deep learning models that use whole-slide histopathological images opening the possibility for other institutions to contribute their data and train models that generalize better on unseen data.  

Despite the advantages, FL is not without limitations. It remains susceptible to security vulnerabilities, including backdoors, data poisoning, membership inference, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based attacks, and differential privacy breaches [@hasanSecurityPrivacyIssues2023]. Moreover, even the transfer of model weights could expose information related to the training datasets through reverse engineering [@shellerFederatedLearningMedicine2020]. Bias propagation is another concern, as it may lead to unequal treatment outcomes for different patient groups [@changBiasPropagationFederated2023]. Nonetheless, FL still represents a transformative approach to AI in healthcare by facilitating the development of more accurate diagnostic models without direct interaction with confidential data. Specific interventions can also be implemented to mitigate these concerns such as the usage of differential privacy to further mask real data.  

Regarding the dataset to be used (GasHisSDB) [@huGasHisSDBNewGastric], the developers of the dataset sourced the images from Longhua Hospital Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, which were then augmented by biomedical researchers from Northeastern University and experienced pathologists from Liaoning Cancer Hospital and Institute. To assess the useability of the images, the developers performed classification through classical machine learning methods (Random Forest, linear Support Vector Machine) and, deep learning (VGG16, Resnet50 and ViT), demonstrating that classification models performed competently on the database. Other deep-learning studies were also completed using this dataset by @yongHistopathologicalGastricCancer2023 and @khayatianHistopathologyImageAnalysis2024 which further solidified the viability of the dataset for training gastric image classifiers.
