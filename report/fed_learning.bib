  abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the leading death cause among women nowadays. Several methods have been proposed for the detection of breast cancer. Various machine learning-based automatic diagnosis systems have been developed known as Computer Aided Diagnostics (CAD) systems. Initial CAD systems were based on machine learning algorithms however due to the automatic feature extraction ability of convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based deep learning models are widely adopted. Deep learning is widely used in various fields. Healthcare is one of the essential field that deep learning has transformed. Another common issue faced by the patients is difference of opinion among different pathologists and medical practitioners. Such human errors often lead to misleading or delayed judgment, which may be fatal to human life. To improve decision consistency, efficiency, and error reduction, researchers in the field of healthcare are using deep learning-based approaches and achieved state of art results. In this study, a deep learning (DL) and transfer learning-based approach is proposed to classify histopathological images for breast cancer diagnosis. In this study, we have adopted patch selection approach to classify breast histopathological images on small number of training images using transfer learning without losing the performance. Initially, patches are extracted from Whole Slide Images and fed into the CNN for features extraction. Based on these features, the discriminative patches are selected and then fed to Efficient-Net architecture pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. Features extracted from Efficient-Net architecture are also used to train a SVM classifier. The proposed model outperforms the baseline methods in terms of multiple performance measures.},

  abstract = {Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Over 95\% of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which are typically classified based on anatomic location and histologic type. Gastric cancer generally carries a poor prognosis because it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Systemic therapy can provide palliation, improved survival, and enhanced quality of life in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. The implementation of biomarker testing, especially analysis of HER2 status, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), has had a significant impact on clinical practice and patient care. Targeted therapies including trastuzumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab have produced encouraging results in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Palliative management, which may include systemic therapy, chemoradiation, and/or best supportive care, is recommended for all patients with unresectable or metastatic cancer. Multidisciplinary team management is essential for all patients with localized gastric cancer. This selection from the NCCN Guidelines for Gastric Cancer focuses on the management of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease.},

Materials and Methods We evaluated 14 patients who underwent computed tomography in a 16-channel scanner for preoperative staging of gastric adenocarcinoma between September 2015 and December 2016. All images were analyzed by the same radiologist, who had extensive experience in abdominal cancer imaging. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the method were calculated by comparing it with the pathology result. All patients underwent partial or total gastrectomy. Results The mean age was 61.5 years, and 53.8\% of the patients were male. The gastric lesions were classified as T1/T2 in 35.7\% of the cases, as T3 in 28.5\%, and as T4 in 35.7\%. Eleven patients (68.7\%) had suspicious (N positive) lymph nodes. The accuracy of the T1/T2, T3, T4, and lymph node staging tests was 85\%, 78\%, 90\%, and 78\%, respectively. The respective sensitivity and specificity values were 71\% and 100\% for T1/T2, 66\% and 81\% for T3, 100\% and 90\% for T4, and 88\% and 60\% for lymph nodes. Conclusion Multidetector computed tomography with a stomach protocol, used in conjunction with virtual gastroscopy, shows good accuracy in the tumor and lymph node staging of gastric adenocarcinoma.},

The present research utilizes an iterative methodology for collaborative learning, using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to construct a breast cancer detection model with a high level of accuracy. By leveraging Federated Learning (FL), this collaborative framework effectively utilizes the combined knowledge and data assets of several healthcare organizations while ensuring the protection of patient privacy and data security. The model described in this study showcases significant progress in the field of breast cancer diagnoses, with a maximum accuracy rate of 97.54\%, precision of 96.5\%, and recall of 98.0\%, by using an optimum feature selection technique. Data augmentation approaches play a crucial role in decreasing loss and improving model performance. Significantly, the F1-Score, a comprehensive metric for evaluating performance, turns out to be 97\%. This study signifies a notable advancement in the field of breast cancer screening, fostering hope for improved patient outcomes via increased accuracy and reliability. This study highlights the potential impact of collaborative learning, namely, in the field of FL, in transforming breast cancer detection. The incorporation of privacy considerations and the use of diverse data sources contribute to the advancement of early detection and the treatment of breast cancer, hence yielding significant benefits for patients on a global scale.},

The study employed 30 semi-structured interviews with researchers at a major Scottish university. The authors analysed the interview transcriptions using directed content analysis. The researchers relied on the four sources of self-efficacy proposed by Bandura (1977) when using social media for knowledge sharing. These sources lead researchers to use social media effectively and frequently for sharing knowledge, although some may discourage its use. It extends the self-efficacy integrative theoretical framework of Bandura (1977) by presenting the relative amount of the influence of these sources for researchers to share their ideas, experiences, questions and research outputs on social media. While the participants included academic staff, postdoctoral researchers, and PhD students, the majority were PhD students. The findings can help universities understand how to promote productive use of social media. For example, academic staff who have high personal mastery experience could mentor those who do not. This is the first known study to investigate the sources of self-efficacy that impact researchers' use of social media for knowledge sharing.},

Based upon a content analysis of Facebook and Twitter digital trace data and a linked online survey (N{\textbackslash},={\textbackslash},783), this study reveals that sharing fact-checks in political conversations on social media is linked to age, ideology, and political behaviors. Moreover, an individual's need for orientation (NFO) is an even stronger predictor of sharing a fact-check than ideological intensity or relevance, alone, and also influences the type of fact-check format (with or without a rating scale) that is shared. Finally, participants generally shared fact-checks to reinforce their existing attitudes. Consequently, concerns over the effects of fact-checking should move beyond a limited-effects approach (e.g., changing attitudes) to also include reinforcing accurate beliefs.},

Drawing on decades of his own research and business experience, Aral goes under the hood of the most powerful social networks to tackle the critical question of just how much social media actually shapes our choices, for better or worse. He shows how the tech behind social media offers the same set of behavior influencing levers to everyone who hopes to change the way we think and act--from Russian hackers to brand marketers--which is why its consequences affect everything from elections to business, dating to health. Along the way, he covers a wide array of topics, including how network effects fuel Twitter's and Facebook's massive growth, the neuroscience of how social media affects our brains, the real consequences of fake news, the power of social ratings, and the impact of social media on our kids. In mapping out strategies for being more thoughtful consumers of social media, The Hype Machine offers the definitive guide to understanding and harnessing for good the technology that has redefined our world overnight.},

  abstract = {Radiomics is an emerging area in quantitative image analysis that aims to relate large-scale extracted imaging information to clinical and biological endpoints. The development of quantitative imaging methods along with machine learning has enabled the opportunity to move data science research towards translation for more personalized cancer treatments. Accumulating evidence has indeed demonstrated that non-invasive advanced imaging analytics, i.e., radiomics, can reveal key components of tumor phenotype for multiple three-dimensional lesions at multiple time points over and beyond the course of treatment. These developments in the use of CT, PET, US and MR imaging could augment patient stratification and prognostication buttressing emerging targeted therapeutic approaches. In recent years, deep learning architectures have demonstrated their tremendous potential for image segmentation, reconstruction, recognition, and classification. Many powerful open-source and commercial platforms are currently available to embark in new research areas of radiomics. Quantitative imaging research, however, is complex and key statistical principles should be followed to realize its full potential. The field of radiomics, in particular, require a renewed focus on optimal study design/reporting practices and standardization of image acquisition, feature calculation and rigorous statistical analysis for the field to move forward. In this article, the role of machine and deep learning as a major computational vehicle for advanced model building of radiomics-based signatures or classifiers, and diverse clinical applications, working principles, research opportunities and available computational platforms for radiomics will be reviewed with examples drawn primarily from oncology. We also address issues related to common applications in medical physics, such as standardization, feature extraction, model building, and validation.},

  abstract = {Gastric adenocarcinoma carries a poor prognosis, in part due to the late stage of diagnosis. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, family history of gastric cancer---in particular, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and pernicious anaemia. The stages in the progression to cancer include chronic gastritis, gastric atrophy (GA), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia. The key to early detection of cancer and improved survival is to non-invasively identify those at risk before endoscopy. However, although biomarkers may help in the detection of patients with chronic atrophic gastritis, there is insufficient evidence to support their use for population screening. High-quality endoscopy with full mucosal visualisation is an important part of improving early detection. Image-enhanced endoscopy combined with biopsy sampling for histopathology is the best approach to detect and accurately risk-stratify GA and GIM. Biopsies following the Sydney protocol from the antrum, incisura, lesser and greater curvature allow both diagnostic confirmation and risk stratification for progression to cancer. Ideally biopsies should be directed to areas of GA or GIM visualised by high-quality endoscopy. There is insufficient evidence to support screening in a low-risk population (undergoing routine diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) such as the UK, but endoscopic surveillance every 3{\textbackslash},years should be offered to patients with extensive GA or GIM. Endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection of visible gastric dysplasia and early cancer has been shown to be efficacious with a high success rate and low rate of recurrence, providing that specific quality criteria are met.}

  abstract = {Purpose Destination monitoring is crucial to understand performance and identify key points of differentiation. Visitor satisfaction is an essential driver of destination performance. With the fast-growing volume of user-generated content through social media, it is now possible to tap into very large amounts of data provided by travellers as they share their experiences. Analysing these data for consumer sentiment has become attractive for destinations and companies. The idea of drawing on social media sentiment for satisfaction monitoring aligns well with the broader move towards smart destinations and real-time information processing. Thus, this paper aims to examine whether the electronic word of mouth originating from Twitter posts offers a useful source for assessing destination sentiment. Importantly, this research examines what caveats need to be considered when interpreting the findings. This research focusses on a prominent tourist destination situated on Australia's East Coast, the Gold Coast. Using a geographically informed filtering process, a collection of tweets posted from within the Gold Coast destination was created and analysed. Metadata were analysed to assess the population of Twitter users, and sentiment analysis, using the Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning algorithm, was performed. Twitter posts provide considerable information, including about who is visiting and what sentiment visitors and residents express when sending tweets from a destination. They also uncover some challenges, including the ``noise'' of Twitter data and the fact that users are not representative of the broader population, in particular for international visitors. This paper highlights limitations such as lack of representativeness of the Twitter data, positive bias and the generic nature of many tweets. Suggestions for how to improve the analysis and value of tweets as a data source are made. This paper contributes to understanding the value of non-traditional data sources for destination monitoring, in particular by highlighting some of the pitfalls of using information sources, such as Twitter. Further research steps have been identified, especially with a view to improving target-specific sentiment scores and the future employment of big-data approaches that involve integrating multiple data sources for destination performance monitoring. The identification of cost-effective ways of measuring and monitoring guest satisfaction can lead to improvements in destination management. This in turn will enhance customer experience and possibly even resident satisfaction. The social benefits, especially at times of considerable visitation pressure, can be important. The use of Twitter data for the monitoring of visitor sentiment at tourist destinations is novel, and the analysis presented here provides unique insights into the potential, but also the caveats, of developing new, smart systems for tourism.},

It is shown here that FL solves the preceding issues with a shared global deep learning (DL) model via a central aggregator server. This paper examines recent developments and provides a comprehensive list of unresolved issues, inspired by the rapid growth of FL research. In the context of FL, several privacy methods are described, including secure multiparty computation, homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, and stochastic gradient descent. Furthermore, a review of various FL classes, such as horizontal and vertical FL and federated transfer learning, is provided. FL has applications in wireless communication, service recommendation, intelligent medical diagnosis systems, and healthcare, all of which are discussed in this paper. We also present a thorough review of existing FL challenges, such as privacy protection, communication cost, system heterogeneity, and unreliable model upload, followed by future research directions.},

The behavior of such performance indices and some combinations of them are analyzed and discussed. To measure the indices we experiment the use of DNNs on two different computer architectures, a workstation equipped with a NVIDIA Titan X Pascal and an embedded system based on a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board. This experimentation allows a direct comparison between DNNs running on machines with very different computational capacity. This study is useful for researchers to have a complete view of what solutions have been explored so far and in which research directions are worth exploring in the future; and for practitioners to select the DNN architecture(s) that better fit the resource constraints of practical deployments and applications. To complete this work, all the DNNs, as well as the software used for the analysis, are available online.},

To measure the performance of our rf component mining for food recognition, we introduce a novel and challenging dataset of 101 food categories, with 101'000 images. With an average accuracy of 50.76\%, our model outperforms alternative classification methods except for cnn, including svm classification on Improved Fisher Vectors and existing discriminative part-mining algorithms by 11.88\% and 8.13\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to study the possible relationship between elements of personality as measured by the Myers-Briggs type indicator (MBTI) and transformational leadership (TL) as measured by the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). Design/methodology/approach - The study was done at the North American manufacturing facility of an international technology company. Utilizing the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire to measure transformational leadership, over 2,000 followers provided assessments of transformational leadership for 148 managers who had done self-assessments and had completed Form K of the MBTI. Findings - No relationship was found between follower assessments of transformational leadership and leader personality as measured by the MBTI. Leaders did, however, perceive themselves to be significantly more transformational than did those who reported to them. Leader preference for extraversion over introversion and intuition over perception were both significantly associated with self-reports of transformational leadership. Research limitations/implications - Studies utilizing large samples across a variety of organizational settings are needed to confirm the results of this study. Practical implications - This study calls into question the existence of a relationship between the MBTI and transformational leadership. The study does not provide any support for the possible utility of the MBTI for the prediction or explanation of transformational leadership behaviors. Assuming that followers' perceptions of TL are the more valid, the findings suggest that previous results linking MBTI and TL may be measurement artifacts. Originality/value - Utilizing a large sample, the MLQ and continuous measures of MBTI preferences the results of this study contradict previous reports of a relationship between personality as measured by the MBTI and transformational leadership.},

Since its launch in 2006, Twitter has evolved from a niche service to a mass phenomenon; it has become instrumental for everyday communication as well as for political debates, crisis communication, marketing, and cultural participation. But the basic idea behind it has stayed the same: users may post short messages (tweets) of up to 140 characters and follow the updates posted by other users. Drawing on the experience of leading international Twitter researchers from a variety of disciplines and contexts, this is the first book to document the various notions and concepts of Twitter communication, providing a detailed and comprehensive overview of current research into the uses of Twitter. It also presents methods for analyzing Twitter data and outlines their practical application in different research contexts., {\textpm}[T]his book is a great resource for educators and researchers alike in the growing field of social media communication.

There are recognized carcinogen agents, such as obesity, tobacco, meat, alcohol consumption and some dietary protective factors. Strategies of early diagnosis through population-based surveillance programs have been demonstrated to be effective in lowering the morbidity and mortality related to GC in some countries. Indeed, the detection of early lesions is very important in order to offer minimally invasive treatments. Endoscopic resection is the gold standard for lesions with a low risk of lymph node metastasis, whereas surgical mini-invasive approaches can be considered in early lesions when endoscopy is not curative. This review outlines the role of lifestyle and prevention strategies for GC, in order to reduce the patients' risk factors, implement the surveillance of precancerous conditions and, therefore, improve the diagnosis of early lesions. Furthermore, we summarize the available treatments for early gastric cancer.},

Prevention and individualized treatment are considered to be the best options for reducing the mortality rate of gastric cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been widely used in the field of gastric cancer, including diagnosis, prognosis, and image analysis. Eligible papers were identified from PubMed and IEEE up to April 13, 2022. Through the comparison of these articles, the application status of AI technology in the diagnosis of gastric cancer was summarized, including application types, application scenarios, advantages and limitations. This review presents the current state and role of AI in the diagnosis of gastric cancer based on four aspects: 1) accurate sampling from early diagnosis (endoscopy), 2) digital pathological diagnosis, 3) molecules and genes, and 4) clinical big data analysis and prognosis prediction. AI plays a very important role in facilitating the diagnosis of gastric cancer; however, it also has shortcomings such as interpretability.

Participants included patients with clinical stage II or III disease treated with preoperative chemotherapy and curative-intent resection, excluding radiotherapy.  Preoperative chemosensitivity was defined as very sensitive (ypT0N0), sensitive (pathological TNM stage\,less than\,clinical, excluding ypT0N0), and refractory (pathological\,greater than or equal to\,clinical). Data were analyzed in April 2021.Receipt of PC or not.Overall survival from surgical discharge.This study included 2382 patients (1599 men [67\%]; median [IQR] age, 63 [54-70] years). Most patients (1524 patients [64\%]) received no PC. Most patients (1483 patients [62\%]) had refractory disease, followed by sensitive disease (727 patients [31\%]) and very sensitive disease (172 patients [7\%]). Patients with older age (odds ratio [OR], 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.00), comorbidity (OR, 0.71; 95\% CI, 0.57-0.90), longer time from chemotherapy initiation to surgery (OR, 0.99; 95\% CI, 0.97-1.00), less sensitivity to preoperative chemotherapy (very sensitive vs refractory OR, 0.58; 95\% CI, 0.37-0.89; sensitive vs refractory OR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.20), and longer surgical hospitalization (OR, 0.95; 95\% CI, 0.93-0.97) had a significantly lower likelihood of receiving PC. PC was not associated with improved survival in the whole group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.75-1.02). Patients with refractory disease had the worst survival compared with patients with sensitive disease (HR, 0.39; 95\% CI, 0.32-0.46) and those with very sensitive disease (HR, 0.12; 95\% CI, 0.07-0.20). Preoperative chemosensitivity was significantly associated with the survival benefit from PC (P\,for interaction\,=\,.03). PC was significantly associated with longer survival in patients with sensitive disease (5-year survival rate, 73.8\% in the PC group vs 65.0\% in the no PC group; HR, 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.46-0.91), but not in those with very sensitive disease (5-year survival rate, 80.0\% in the PC group vs 90.8\% in the no PC group; HR, 2.45; 95\% CI, 0.81-7.43) and those with refractory disease (5-year survival rate, 41.8\% in the PC group vs 40.7\% in the no PC group; HR, 0.93; 95\% CI, 0.79-1.10).In this cohort study, preoperative chemosensitivity was associated with survival among patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma who received PC.

Billions of data bytes, generated at the network edge, put massive demands on data processing and structural optimization. Thus, there exists a strong demand to integrate Edge Computing and AI, which gives birth to Edge Intelligence. In this paper, we divide Edge Intelligence into AI for edge (Intelligence-enabled Edge Computing) and AI on edge (Artificial Intelligence on Edge). The former focuses on providing more optimal solutions to key problems in Edge Computing with the help of popular and effective AI technologies while the latter studies how to carry out the entire process of building AI models, i.e., model training and inference, on the edge. This paper provides insights into this new inter-disciplinary field from a broader perspective. It discusses the core concepts and the research road-map, which should provide the necessary background for potential future research initiatives in Edge Intelligence.},

Deep learning is an effective means to assist radiologists to analyze the vast amount of chest X-ray images, which can potentially have a substantial role in streamlining and accelerating the diagnosis of COVID-19. Such techniques involve large datasets for training and all such data must be centralized in order to be processed. Due to medical data privacy regulations, it is often not possible to collect and share patient data in a centralized data server. In this work, we present a collaborative federated learning framework allowing multiple medical institutions screening COVID-19 from Chest X-ray images using deep learning without sharing patient data. We investigate several key properties and specificities of federated learning setting including the not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and unbalanced data distributions that naturally arise. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed federated learning framework provides competitive results to that of models trained by sharing data, considering two different model architectures. These findings would encourage medical institutions to adopt collaborative process and reap benefits of the rich private data in order to rapidly build a powerful model for COVID-19 screening.},

Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised-learning are only a few of the strategies that have been developed to accommodate different types of learning. A number of experiments showed that deep learning systems fared better than traditional ones when it came to image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Several real-world applications and hierarchical systems have utilised transfer learning and deep learning algorithms for pattern recognition and classification tasks. Real-world machine learning settings, on the other hand, often do not support this assumption since training data can be difficult or expensive to get, and there is a constant need to generate high-performance beginners who can work with data from a variety of sources. The objective of this paper is using deep learning to uncover higher-level representational features, to clearly explain transfer learning, to provide current solutions and evaluate applications in diverse areas of transfer learning as well as deep learning.},

Descriptive and normative research approaches have been utilized in this study. By using the analytic hierarchy process tool and the transformational leadership (TL) sand cone model, a series of 26 survey responses from experienced leaders from four different departments in a multinational company were analyzed. The results support a view that the sand cone model is a simple holistic analytic concept to visualize a clear TL profile, as a vital role of KM. Moreover, three practical findings are: First, significance features and factors to help the organization in having a better understanding of their current TL capabilities. Second, a new comprehensive layout for the TL sand cone model to increase the self-awareness for the decision makers. Third, five new equations for TL indexes, that is, the specific index, outcome index, leadership index, resource index, and total TL index that provide a useful and precise assessment for the leaders.},

  abstract = {Gastric carcinoma (GC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Surgical resection is the only cure available and is dependent on the GC stage at presentation, which incorporates depth of tumor invasion, extent of lymph node and distant metastases. Accurate preoperative staging is therefore essential for optimal surgical management with consideration of preoperative and/or postoperative chemotherapy. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with its ability to assess tumor depth, nodal disease and metastases is the preferred technique for staging GC. Endoscopic ultrasonography is more accurate for assessing the depth of wall invasion in early cancer, but is limited in the assessment of advanced local or stenotic cancer and detection of distant metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although useful for staging, is not proven to be effective. Positron emission tomography (PET) is most useful for detecting and characterizing distant metastases. Both MDCT and PET are useful for assessment of treatment response following preoperative chemotherapy and for detection of recurrence after surgical resection. This review article discusses the usefulness of imaging modalities for detecting, staging and assessing treatment response for GC and the potential role of newer applications including CT volumetry, virtual gastroscopy and perfusion CT in the management of GC.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) poses a significant health risk globally, particularly among the elderly population. Recent studies underscore its prevalence, with over 50\% of elderly Japanese facing a lifetime risk of dementia, primarily attributed to AD. As the most prevalent form of dementia, AD gradually erodes brain cells, leading to severe neurological decline. In this scenario, it is important to develop an automatic AD-detection system, and many researchers have been working to develop an AD-detection system by taking advantage of the advancement of deep learning (DL) techniques, which have shown promising results in various domains, including medical image analysis. However, existing approaches for AD detection often suffer from limited performance due to the complexities associated with training hierarchical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-stage deep neural network architecture based on residual functions to address the limitations of existing AD-detection approaches. Inspired by the success of residual networks (ResNets) in image-classification tasks, our proposed system comprises five stages, each explicitly formulated to enhance feature effectiveness while maintaining model depth. Following feature extraction, a deep learning-based feature-selection module is applied to mitigate overfitting, incorporating batch normalization, dropout and fully connected layers. Subsequently, machine learning (ML)-based classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and SoftMax, are employed for classification tasks. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T, MIRAID and OASIS Kaggle, demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model. Impressively, our model achieves accuracy rates of 99.47\%, 99.10\% and 99.70\% for ADNI1: Complete 1Yr 1.5T, MIRAID and OASIS datasets, respectively, outperforming existing systems in binary class problems.

  abstract = {This paper analyzes online user conversation topics and discourse on Twitter related to the ``Liberate'' Protest movement in reaction to social distancing guidelines at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interdisciplinary approaches in big data, machine learning, content analysis, and social network analysis (SNA) were used to characterize the communicative behavior, conversation themes, and network structures of Liberate protest supporters and non-supporters. Tweets were content coded and grouped within topic clusters produced from an unsupervised machine learning algorithm using natural language processing. An analysis of topic clusters found that tweets that support the protests are highly concentrated and have higher volumes of replicated tweets. Protest Supporters were also more likely to retweet other users while Non-Supporters were more likely to include a URL from an outside media source and produce a unique tweet. SNA was also used to assess the characteristics of retweet networks and found that the Protester Supporter network had a more centralized structure and was strongly influenced by a political organization, in contrast to the Non-Supporter network that had a larger number of smaller and more evenly-sized nodes and more driven by media personalities and commentators. Collectively, these characteristics indicate that protest supporters had more centralized, consistent and disseminated discourse protesting COVID-19 social distancing requirements compared to non-supporters who were more diverse in their criticism of the Liberate movement and generally more fragmented in their support of public health measures. Results from this study provide important insights into pandemic communication dynamics of opposing twitter communities, including in the context of those who oppose and support public health measures in a highly politicized social and online environment. Results are important in the context of assessing the messages, communication propagation and overall activities of social media communities in response to basic public health measures needed to contain this post-digital era global pandemic.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Image recognition using artificial intelligence with deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has dramatically improved and been increasingly applied to medical fields for diagnostic imaging. We developed a CNN that can automatically detect gastric cancer in endoscopic images. METHODS: A CNN-based diagnostic system was constructed based on Single Shot MultiBox Detector architecture and trained using 13,584 endoscopic images of gastric cancer. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, an independent test set of 2296 stomach images collected from 69 consecutive patients with 77 gastric cancer lesions was applied to the constructed CNN. RESULTS: The CNN required 47~s to analyze 2296 test images. The CNN correctly diagnosed 71 of 77 gastric cancer lesions with an overall sensitivity of 92.2\%, and 161 non-cancerous lesions were detected as gastric cancer, resulting in a positive predictive value of 30.6\%. Seventy of the 71 lesions (98.6\%) with a diameter of 6~mm or more as well as all invasive cancers were correctly detected. All missed lesions were superficially depressed and differentiated-type intramucosal cancers that were difficult to distinguish from gastritis even for experienced endoscopists. Nearly half of the false-positive lesions were gastritis with changes in color tone or an irregular mucosal surface. CONCLUSION: The constructed CNN system for detecting gastric cancer could process numerous stored endoscopic images in a very short time with a clinically relevant diagnostic ability. It may be well applicable to daily clinical practice to reduce the burden of endoscopists.},

  abstract = {Various procedure-related adverse events related to colonoscopic treatment have been reported. Previous studies on the complications of colonoscopic treatment have focused primarily on perforation or bleeding. Coagulation syndrome (CS), which is synonymous with transmural burn syndrome following endoscopic treatment, is another typical adverse event. CS is the result of electrocoagulation injury to the bowel wall that induces a transmural burn and localized peritonitis resulting in serosal inflammation. CS occurs after polypectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), and even endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The occurrence of CS after polypectomy or EMR varies according previous reports; most report an occurrence rate around 1\%. However, artificial ulcers after ESD are largely theoretical, and CS following ESD was reported in about 9\% of cases, which is higher than that for CS after polypectomy or EMR. Most cases of post-polypectomy syndrome (PPS) have an excellent prognosis, and they are managed conservatively with medical therapy. PPS rarely develops into delayed perforation. Delayed perforation is a severe adverse event that often requires emergency surgery. Since few studies have reported on CS and delayed perforation associated with CS, we focused on CS after colonoscopic treatments in this review. Clinicians should consider delayed perforation in CS patients.},

MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 15{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 4.6{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% more accurate while reducing latency by 5{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Large detection is 25{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 30{\textbackslash}textbackslash\% faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.

  abstract = {Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world. At the same time, it is also the fourth most deadly cancer. Early detection of cancer exists as a guide for the treatment of gastric cancer. Nowadays, computer technology has advanced rapidly to assist physicians in the diagnosis of pathological pictures of gastric cancer. Ensemble learning is a way to improve the accuracy of algorithms, and finding multiple learning models with complementarity types is the basis of ensemble learning. The complementarity of sub-size pathology image classifiers when machine performance is insufficient is explored in this experimental platform. We choose seven classical machine learning classifiers and four deep learning classifiers for classification experiments on the GasHisSDB database. Among them, classical machine learning algorithms extract five different image virtual features to match multiple classifier algorithms. For deep learning, we choose three convolutional neural network classifiers. In addition, we also choose a novel Transformer-based classifier. The experimental platform, in which a large number of classical machine learning and deep learning methods are performed, demonstrates that there are differences in the performance of different classifiers on GasHisSDB. Classical machine learning models exist for classifiers that classify Abnormal categories very well, while classifiers that excel in classifying Normal categories also exist. Deep learning models also exist with multiple models that can be complementarity. Suitable classifiers are selected for ensemble learning, when machine performance is insufficient. This experimental platform demonstrates that multiple classifiers are indeed complementarity and can improve the efficiency of ensemble learning. This can better assist doctors in diagnosis, improve the detection of gastric cancer, and increase the cure rate.},

Traditional machine learning achieved the best accuracy rate of 86.08\% and a minimum of just 41.12\%. The best accuracy of deep learning reached 96.47\% and the lowest was 86.21\%. Accuracy rates vary significantly across classifiers. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, it is the first publicly available gastric cancer histopathology dataset containing a large number of images for weakly supervised learning. We believe that GasHisSDB can attract researchers to explore new algorithms for the automated diagnosis of gastric cancer, which can help physicians and patients in the clinical setting.},

In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues become crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classifiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the semantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image categories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Objectives Detecting early gastric cancer is difficult, and it may even be overlooked by experienced endoscopists. Recently, artificial intelligence based on deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has enabled significant advancements in the field of gastroenterology. However, it remains unclear whether a CNN can outperform endoscopists. In this study, we evaluated whether the performance of a CNN in detecting early gastric cancer is better than that of endoscopists. Methods The CNN was constructed using 13,584 endoscopic images from 2639 lesions of gastric cancer. Subsequently, its diagnostic ability was compared to that of 67 endoscopists using an independent test dataset (2940 images from 140 cases). Results The average diagnostic time for analyzing 2940 test endoscopic images by the CNN and endoscopists were 45.5~{\textpm}~1.8~s and 173.0~{\textpm}~66.0~min, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the CNN were 58.4\%, 87.3\%, 26.0\%, and 96.5\%, respectively. These values for the 67 endoscopists were 31.9\%, 97.2\%, 46.2\%, and 94.9\%, respectively. The CNN had a significantly higher sensitivity than the endoscopists (by 26.5\%; 95\% confidence interval, 14.9--32.5\%). Conclusion The CNN detected more early gastric cancer cases in a shorter time than the endoscopists. The CNN needs further training to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy. However, a diagnostic support tool for gastric cancer using a CNN will be realized in the near future.},

  abstract = {Despite the remarkable progress recently made to enhance the resolution of white-light endoscopy, detection, and diagnosis of premalignant lesions, such as adenomas and subtle early-stage cancers, remains a great challenge. As for example, although chromoendoscopy, such as endoscopy using indigo carmine, is useful for the early diagnosis of subtle lesions, the technique presents various disadvantages ranging from the time required for spray application of the dye and suctioning of excess dye to the increased difficulty in identifying lesions in the presence of severe inflammation and obstruction of visual field due to the pooling of solution in depressed-type lesions. To overcome these diagnostic problems associated with chromoendoscopy, research has focused on the development of endoscopes based on new optical technologies. Several types of image-enhanced endoscopy methods have recently been presented. In particular, image-enhanced endoscopy has emerged as a new paradigm for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders. Image-enhanced endoscopes provide high-contrast images of lesions by means of optical or electronic technologies, including the contrast enhancement of the mucosal surface and of blood vessels. Chromoendoscopy, narrow-band imaging, i-SCAN, and flexible spectral imaging color enhancement are representative examples of image-enhanced endoscopy discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades, PET/CT has become an essential modality in oncology increasingly used in the management of gastrointestinal (GI)cancers. Most PET/CT tracers used in clinical practice show some degree of GI uptake. This uptake is quite variable and knowledge of common patterns of biodistribution of various radiotracers is helpful in clinical practice. 18F-Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG) is the most commonly used radiotracer and has quite a variable uptake within the bowel. 68Ga-Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) shows intense uptake within the proximal small bowel loops. 11C-methyl-L-methionine (MET) shows high accumulation within the bowels, which makes it difficult to assess bowel or pelvic diseases. One must also be aware of technical artifacts causing difficulties in interpretations, such as high attenuation oral contrast material within the bowel lumen or misregistration artifact due to patient movements., It is imperative to know the common variants and benign diseases that can mimic malignant pathologies. Intense FDG uptake within the esophagus and stomach may be a normal variant or may be associated with benign conditions such as esophagitis, reflux disease, or gastritis. Metformin can cause diffuse intense uptake throughout the bowel loops. Intense physiologic uptake can also be seen within the anal canal. Segmental bowel uptake can be seen in inflammatory bowel disease, radiation, or medication induced enteritis/colitis or infection. Diagnosis of appendicitis or diverticular disease requires CT correlation, as normal appendix or diverticulum can show intense uptake., Certain malignant pathologies are known to have only low FDG uptake, such as early-stage esophageal adenocarcinoma, mucinous tumors, indolent lymphomas, and multicystic mesotheliomas. Response assessment, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting, can be limited by post-treatment inflammatory changes. Post-operative complications such as abscess or fistula formation can also show intense uptake and may obscure underlying malignant pathology. In the absence of clinical suspicion or rising tumor marker, the role of FDG PET/CT in routine surveillance of patients with GI malignancy is not clear.},

Even though several images do not have a description, humans have the capability to understand them without their captions but this is not the case with machines. As long as machines do not behave, think, and talk like humans, natural language descriptions will be challenging to solve. Although image captioning is a challenging undertaking, numerous researchers have made substantial advancements. Image captioning is the task of automatically generating a textual description of an image. This technology has significant potential for a range of applications, including assistive technologies for visually impaired individuals, content-based image retrieval, and personalized recommendation systems. In this work, CNN-LSTM model is used to generate captions for images by processing its features. This paper mainly describes an image captioning method using a deep learning approach, a combination of LSTM and Xception model, which shows representative work of the model. Xception is used to extract the high-level features of the images. The extracted features alongside the image captions are fed as input to the LSTM which generates the most appropriate caption for the given image. In this work, the model is evaluated using BLEU score, a standard metric that is used for evaluating machine-translated text. This will summarize the images without any human intervention.},

Federated learning is a distributed learning framework that enables multi-institutional collaborations on decentralized data with improved protection for each collaborator's data privacy. In this paper, we propose a communication-efficient scheme for decentralized federated learning called ProxyFL, or proxy-based federated learning. Each participant in ProxyFL maintains two models, a private model, and a publicly shared proxy model designed to protect the participant's privacy. Proxy models allow efficient information exchange among participants without the need of a centralized server. The proposed method eliminates a significant limitation of canonical federated learning by allowing model heterogeneity; each participant can have a private model with any architecture. Furthermore, our protocol for communication by proxy leads to stronger privacy guarantees using differential privacy analysis. Experiments on popular image datasets, and a cancer diagnostic problem using high-quality gigapixel histology whole slide images, show that ProxyFL can outperform existing alternatives with much less communication overhead and stronger privacy. Federated learning enables multi-institutional collaborations on decentralized data with improved privacy protection. Here, authors propose a new scheme for decentralized federated learning with much less communication overhead and stronger privacy.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

  abstract = {Objective. Deep Learning models are often susceptible to failures after deployment. Knowing when your model is producing inadequate predictions is crucial. In this work, we investigate the utility of Monte Carlo (MC) dropout and the efficacy of the proposed uncertainty metric (UM) for flagging of unacceptable pectoral muscle segmentations in mammograms. Approach. Segmentation of pectoral muscle was performed with modified ResNet18 convolutional neural network. MC dropout layers were kept unlocked at inference time. For each mammogram, 50 pectoral muscle segmentations were generated. The mean was used to produce the final segmentation and the standard deviation was applied for the estimation of uncertainty. From each pectoral muscle uncertainty map, the overall UM was calculated. To validate the UM, a correlation between the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and UM was used. The UM was first validated in a training set (200 mammograms) and finally tested in an independent dataset (300 mammograms). ROC-AUC analysis was performed to test the discriminatory power of the proposed UM for flagging unacceptable segmentations. Main results. The introduction of dropout layers in the model improved segmentation performance (DSC = 0.95 {\textpm} 0.07 versus DSC = 0.93 {\textpm} 0.10). Strong anti-correlation (r = -0.76, p {$<$} 0.001) between the proposed UM and DSC was observed. A high AUC of 0.98 (97\% specificity at 100\% sensitivity) was obtained for the discrimination of unacceptable segmentations. Qualitative inspection by the radiologist revealed that images with high UM are difficult to segment. Significance. The use of MC dropout at inference time in combination with the proposed UM enables flagging of unacceptable pectoral muscle segmentations from mammograms with excellent discriminatory power.},

  abstract = {Background: Gastric cancer (GC), a significant health burden worldwide, is typically diagnosed in the advanced stages due to its non-specific symptoms and complex morphological features. Deep learning (DL) has shown potential for improving and standardizing early GC detection. This systematic review aims to evaluate the current status of DL in pre-malignant, early-stage, and gastric neoplasia analysis. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE for original studies implementing DL algorithms for gastric neoplasia detection using endoscopic images. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The focus was on studies providing quantitative diagnostic performance measures and those comparing AI performance with human endoscopists. Results: Our review encompasses 42 studies that utilize a variety of DL techniques. The findings demonstrate the utility of DL in GC classification, detection, tumor invasion depth assessment, cancer margin delineation, lesion segmentation, and detection of early-stage and pre-malignant lesions. Notably, DL models frequently matched or outperformed human endoscopists in diagnostic accuracy. However, heterogeneity in DL algorithms, imaging techniques, and study designs precluded a definitive conclusion about the best algorithmic approach. Conclusions: The promise of artificial intelligence in improving and standardizing gastric neoplasia detection, diagnosis, and segmentation is significant. This review is limited by predominantly single-center studies and undisclosed datasets used in AI training, impacting generalizability and demographic representation. Further, retrospective algorithm training may not reflect actual clinical performance, and a lack of model details hinders replication efforts. More research is needed to substantiate these findings, including larger-scale multi-center studies, prospective clinical trials, and comprehensive technical reporting of DL algorithms and datasets, particularly regarding the heterogeneity in DL algorithms and study designs.},

  abstract = {Fake news or misinformation is the information or stories intentionally created to deceive or mislead the readers. Nowadays, social media platforms have become the ripe grounds for misinformation, spreading them in a few minutes, which led to chaos, panic, and potential health hazards among people. The rapid dissemination and a prolific rise in the spread of fake news and misinformation create the most time-critical challenges for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community. Relevant literature reveals that the presence of an element of surprise in the story is a strong driving force for the rapid dissemination of misinformation, which attracts immediate attention and invokes strong emotional stimulus in the reader. False stories or fake information are written to arouse interest and activate the emotions of people to spread it. Thus, false stories have a higher level of novelty and emotional content than true stories. Hence, Novelty of the news item and recognizing the Emotional state of the reader after reading the item seems two key tasks to tightly couple with misinformation Detection. Previous literature did not explore misinformation detection with mutual learning for novelty detection and emotion recognition to the best of our knowledge. Our current work argues that joint learning of novelty and emotion from the target text makes a strong case for misinformation detection. In this paper, we propose a deep multitask learning framework that jointly performs novelty detection, emotion recognition, and misinformation detection. Our deep multitask model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for fake news detection on four benchmark datasets, viz. ByteDance, FNC, Covid-Stance and FNID with 7.73\%, 3.69\%, 7.95\% and 13.38\% accuracy gain, respectively. The evaluation shows that our multitask learning framework improves the performance over the single-task framework for four datasets with 7.8\%, 28.62\%, 11.46\%, and 15.66\% overall accuracy gain. We claim that textual novelty and emotion are the two key aspects to consider while developing an automatic fake news detection mechanism.

This paper suggests a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model for flood forecasting, where the daily discharge and rainfall were used as input data. Moreover, characteristics of the data sets which may influence the model performance were also of interest. As a result, the Da River basin in Vietnam was chosen and two different combinations of input data sets from before 1985 (when the Hoa Binh dam was built) were used for one-day, two-day, and three-day flowrate forecasting ahead at Hoa Binh Station. The predictive ability of the model is quite impressive: The Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) reached 99\%, 95\%, and 87\% corresponding to three forecasting cases, respectively. The findings of this study suggest a viable option for flood forecasting on the Da River in Vietnam, where the river basin stretches between many countries and downstream flows (Vietnam) may fluctuate suddenly due to flood discharge from upstream hydroelectric reservoirs.}

This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of ME and compare the accuracy of ME with different optical imaging in detecting EGC. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all relevant studies. Pair-wise meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of ME, and Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to combine direct and indirect evidence and estimate the relative effects. Results: Eight prospective studies were identified with a total of 5948 patients and 3 optical imaging in ME (ME with WLI (M-WLI), ME with narrow-band imaging (M-NBI), and ME with blue laser imaging (M-BLI)). Pair-wise meta-analysis showed a higher accuracy of ME than C-WLI (OR: 2.97, 95\% CI: 1.68{\textbackslash}sim5.25). In network meta-analysis, both M-NBI and M-BLI were more accurate than M-WLI (OR: 2.56, 95\% CI: 2.13{\textbackslash}sim3.13; OR: 3.13, 95\% CI: 1.85{\textbackslash}sim5.71). There was no significant difference between M-NBI and M-BLI. Conclusion: ME was effective in improving the detecting rate of EGC, especially with NBI or BLI.}

However, there are the following problems in real scenes: the required data may not be available in a single institution due to the number of patients or the type of pathology, and it is often not feasible to share patient data due to medical data privacy regulations. This means keeping private data safe is required and has become an obstacle in fusing data from multi-party to train a medical model. To solve the problems, we propose a federated learning framework, which allows knowledge fusion achieved by sharing the model parameters of each client through federated training rather than sharing data. Based on breast cancer histopathological dataset (BreakHis), our federated learning experiments achieve the expected results which are similar to the performances of the centralized learning and verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel deep network structure called "Network In Network" (NIN) to enhance model discriminability for local patches within the receptive field. The conventional convolutional layer uses linear filters followed by a nonlinear activation function to scan the input. Instead, we build micro neural networks with more complex structures to abstract the data within the receptive field. We instantiate the micro neural network with a multilayer perceptron, which is a potent function approximator. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the micro networks over the input in a similar manner as CNN; they are then fed into the next layer. Deep NIN can be implemented by stacking mutiple of the above described structure. With enhanced local modeling via the micro network, we are able to utilize global average pooling over feature maps in the classification layer, which is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting than traditional fully connected layers. We demonstrated the state-of-the-art classification performances with NIN on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and reasonable performances on SVHN and MNIST datasets.},

However, in reality, data are mostly scattered across different organizations and cannot be easily integrated due to many legal and practical constraints. To address this important challenge in the field of machine learning, we introduce a new technique and framework, known as federated transfer learning (FTL), to improve statistical modeling under a data federation. FTL allows knowledge to be shared without compromising user privacy and enables complementary knowledge to be transferred across domains in a data federation, thereby enabling a target-domain party to build flexible and effective models by leveraging rich labels from a source domain. This framework requires minimal modifications to the existing model structure and provides the same level of accuracy as the non-privacy-preserving transfer learning. It is flexible and can be effectively adapted to various secure multi-party machine learning tasks.},

  abstract = {Deep Learning-based computational pathology algorithms have demonstrated profound ability to excel in a wide array of tasks that range from characterization of well known morphological phenotypes to predicting non-human-identifiable features from histology such as molecular alterations. However, the development of robust, adaptable, and accurate deep learning-based models often rely on the collection and time-costly curation large high-quality annotated training data that should ideally come from diverse sources and patient populations to cater for the heterogeneity that exists in such datasets. Multi-centric and collaborative integration of medical data across multiple institutions can naturally help overcome this challenge and boost the model performance but is limited by privacy concerns amongst other difficulties that may arise in the complex data sharing process as models scale towards using hundreds of thousands of gigapixel whole slide images. In this paper, we introduce privacy-preserving federated learning for gigapixel whole slide images in computational pathology using weakly-supervised attention multiple instance learning and differential privacy. We evaluated our approach on two different diagnostic problems using thousands of histology whole slide images with only slide-level labels. Additionally, we present a weakly-supervised learning framework for survival prediction and patient stratification from whole slide images and demonstrate its effectiveness in a federated setting. Our results show that using federated learning, we can effectively develop accurate weakly supervised deep learning models from distributed data silos without direct data sharing and its associated complexities, while also preserving differential privacy using randomized noise generation.},

  abstract = {Federated learning is a very convenient approach for scenarios where (i) the exchange of data implies privacy concerns and/or (ii) a quick reaction is needed. In smart healthcare systems, both aspects are usually required. In this paper, we work on the first scenario, where preserving privacy is key and, consequently, building a unique and massive medical image data set by fusing different data sets from different medical institutions or research centers (computation nodes) is not an option. We propose an ensemble federated learning (EFL) approach that is based on the following characteristics: First, each computation node works with a different data set (but of the same type). They work locally and apply an ensemble approach combining eight well-known CNN models (densenet169, mobilenetv2, xception, inceptionv3, vgg16, resnet50, densenet121, and resnet152v2) on Chest X-ray images. Second, the best two local models are used to create a local ensemble model that is shared with a central node. Third, the ensemble models are aggregated to obtain a global model, which is shared with the computation nodes to continue with a new iteration. This procedure continues until there are no changes in the best local models. We have performed different experiments to compare our approach with centralized ones (with or without an ensemble approach). The results conclude that our proposal outperforms these ones in Chest X-ray images (achieving an accuracy of 96.63\%) and offers very competitive results compared to other proposals in the literature.

In this study, we introduce a combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and support vector machine (SVM), along with a modified bag of visual words (BoVW)-based image classification model. BoVW uses scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented Fast and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) descriptors; as a consequence, the SIFT--ORB--BoVW model developed contains highly discriminating features, which enhance the performance of the classifier. To identify appropriate images and overcome challenges, we have also explored the possibility of utilizing a fuzzy Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) approach. This study also discusses using CNNs/SVM to improve the proposed feature extractor's ability to learn more relevant visual vocabulary from the image. The proposed technique was compared with classic BoVW. The experimental results proved the significant enhancement of the proposed technique in terms of performance and accuracy over state-of-the-art models of BoVW.},

We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. We present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.},

  abstract = {The transformation of printed media into the digital environment and the extensive use of social media have changed the concept of media literacy and people's habits of news consumption. While online news is faster, easier, comparatively cheaper, and offers convenience in terms of people's access to information, it speeds up the dissemination of fake news. Due to the free production and consumption of large amounts of data, fact-checking systems powered by human efforts are not enough to question the credibility of the information provided, or to prevent its rapid dissemination like a virus. Libraries, long known as sources of trusted information, are facing challenges caused by misinformation as mentioned in studies about fake news and libraries.1 Considering that libraries are undergoing digitization processes all over the world and are providing digital media to their users, it is very likely that unverified digital content will be served by world's libraries. The solution is to develop automated mechanisms that can check the credibility of digital content served in libraries without manual validation. For this purpose, we developed an automated fake news detection system based on Turkish digital news content. Our approach can be modified for any other language if there is labelled training material. This model can be integrated into libraries' digital systems to label served news content as potentially fake whenever necessary, preventing uncontrolled falsehood dissemination via libraries.},

  abstract = {As a powerful machine learning method, deep learning has attracted the attention of numerous researchers. While exploring a high-performance neural network model, the floating-point operations of a neural network model are also increasing. In recent years, many researchers have noticed that efficiency is also one of important indicators to measure the property of neural network models. Obviously, the efficient neural network model is more helpful to deploy on mobile and embedded devices. Therefore, the efficient neural network model becomes a hot research spot. In this paper, we review the methods related to the structural design of efficient convolution neural networks in recent years. According to the characteristics of these methods, we divide them into three kinds of methods: model pruning, efficient architecture, and neural architecture search. Detailed analyses of each method are presented to demonstrate their advantages and disadvantages. Then, we comprehensively compare them in detail and propose many suggestions about the design of the efficient convolution neural network model structure. Inspired by these suggestions, we built a new efficient neural network model, SharedNet. And the SharedNet obtains the best accuracy of manually-designed efficient CNN models on the ImageNet dataset.},

  abstract = {Gastric cancer has become a serious worldwide health concern, emphasizing the crucial importance of early diagnosis measures to improve patient outcomes. While traditional histological image analysis is regarded as the clinical gold standard, it is labour intensive and manual. In recognition of this problem, there has been a rise in interest in the use of computer-aided diagnostic tools to help pathologists with their diagnostic efforts. In particular, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a promising solution in this sector. However, current DL models are still restricted in their ability to extract extensive visual characteristics for correct categorization. To address this limitation, this study proposes the use of ensemble models, which incorporate the capabilities of several deep-learning architectures and use aggregate knowledge of many models to improve classification performance, allowing for more accurate and efficient gastric cancer detection. To determine how well these proposed models performed, this study compared them with other works, all of which were based on the Gastric Histopathology Sub-Size Images Database, a publicly available dataset for gastric cancer. This research demonstrates that the ensemble models achieved a high detection accuracy across all sub-databases, with an average accuracy exceeding 99\%. Specifically, ResNet50, VGGNet, and ResNet34 performed better than EfficientNet and VitNet. For the 80 {\texttimes} 80-pixel sub-database, ResNet34 exhibited an accuracy of approximately 93\%, VGGNet achieved 94\%, and the ensemble model excelled with 99\%. In the 120 {\texttimes} 120-pixel sub-database, the ensemble model showed 99\% accuracy, VGGNet 97\%, and ResNet50 approximately 97\%. For the 160 {\texttimes} 160-pixel sub-database, the ensemble model again achieved 99\% accuracy, VGGNet 98\%, ResNet50 98\%, and EfficientNet 92\%, highlighting the ensemble model's superior performance across all resolutions. Overall, the ensemble model consistently provided an accuracy of 99\% across the three sub-pixel categories. These findings show that ensemble models may successfully detect critical characteristics from smaller patches and achieve high performance. The findings will help pathologists diagnose gastric cancer using histopathological images, leading to earlier identification and higher patient survival rates.},

  abstract = {Machine learning has been constantly evolving and revolutionizing every aspect of our lives. There is ongoing research to enhance and modify machine learning models where scientists and researchers are finding ways to improve the effectiveness and adaptability of models with the changing technology moulding to user requirements for real life application. The main challenges in this endeavour of enhancing machine learning models are obtaining quality data, selecting an appropriate model, and ensuring the data privacy. Federated learning has been developed to address the aforementioned challenges, which is an effective way to train machine learning models in a collaborative manner by using the local data from a large number of devices without directly exchanging their raw data whilst simultaneously delivering on model performance. Federated learning is not just a type of machine learning, it is an amalgamation of several technologies and techniques. To fully understand its concepts a comprehensive study is required. This paper aims to simplify the fundamentals of federated learning in order to provide a better understanding of it. It explains federated learning in a step-by-step manner covering its comprehensive definition, detailed working, different types, benefits and limitations.},

  abstract = {Colorectal cancer is the fourth fatal disease in the world, and the massive burden on the pathologists related to the classification of precancerous and cancerous colorectal lesions can be decreased by deep learning (DL) methods. However, the data privacy of the patients is a big challenge for being able to train deep learning models using big medical data. Federated Learning is a rising star in this era by providing the ability to train deep learning models on different sites without sacrificing data privacy. In this study, the Big Transfer model, which is a new General Visual Representation Learning method and six other classical DL methods are converted to the federated version. The effect of the federated learning is measured on all these models on four different data settings extracted from the MHIST and Chaoyang datasets. The proposed models are tested for single learning, centralized learning, and federated learning. The best AUC values of federated learning on Chaoyang are obtained by the Big Transfer and VGG models at 90.77\% and 90.76\%, respectively, whereas the best AUC value on MHIST is obtained by the Big Transfer model at 89.72\%. The overall obtained results of models on all data settings show that the contribution of Federated Learning with respect to single learning is 4.71\% and 11.68\% for the ``uniform'' and ``label-biased'' data settings of Chaoyang, respectively, and 6.89\% for the ``difficulty level-biased'' data setting of MHIST. Thus, it is experimentally shown that federated learning can be applied to the field of computational pathology for new institutional collaborations.},

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive information from digital images and take action or suggestions based on that information. CNN is one of the current methods of object detection due to its ease of use and GPU-supported parallel working features. Due to the aim of completing deep learning model training quickly or due to insufficient dataset, many studies using the transfer learning method are carried out in fields such as medicine, agriculture, and weapons. However, there are very few studies that use the fine-tuning method and compare transfer learning in terms of effectiveness. By paying attention to the balanced distribution of the data, approximately 100 images of each chess piece type were included in the analysis and a dataset of at least 1000 images was created. The without transfer learning fine-tune, fine-tuned transfer learning, transfer learning, fully supervised learning (FSL) and weakly supervised learning (WSL) applied models performances compared. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned transfer learning applied YOLO V4 model produces more accurate results than the other models in FSL and the transfer learning applied Faster R-CNN model produces more accurate results than the other models in WSL.},

  abstract = {Regularizing neural networks is an important task to reduce overfitting. Dropout~[1] has been a widely-used regularization trick for neural networks. In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), dropout is usually applied to the fully connected layers. Meanwhile, the regularization effect of dropout in the convolutional layers has not been thoroughly analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we analyze the effect of dropout in the convolutional layers, which is indeed proved as a powerful generalization method. We observed that dropout in CNNs regularizes the networks by adding noise to the output feature maps of each layer, yielding robustness to variations of images. Based on this observation, we propose a stochastic dropout whose drop ratio varies for each iteration. Furthermore, we propose a new regularization method which is inspired by behaviors of image filters. Rather than randomly drop the activation, we selectively drop the activations which have high values across the feature map or across the channels. Experimental results validate the regularization performance of selective max-drop and stochastic dropout is competitive to the dropout or spatial dropout~[2].},

This is currently addressed by sharing multi-site data, but such centralization is challenging/infeasible to scale due to various limitations. Federated ML (FL) provides an alternative paradigm for accurate and generalizable ML, by only sharing numerical model updates. Here we present the largest FL study to-date, involving data from 71 sites across 6 continents, to generate an automatic tumor boundary detector for the rare disease of glioblastoma, reporting the largest such dataset in the literature (               n               \,=\,6,\,314). We demonstrate a 33\% delineation improvement for the surgically targetable tumor, and 23\% for the complete tumor extent, over a publicly trained model. We anticipate our study to: 1) enable more healthcare studies informed by large diverse data, ensuring meaningful results for rare diseases and underrepresented populations, 2) facilitate further analyses for glioblastoma by releasing our consensus model, and 3) demonstrate the FL effectiveness at such scale and task-complexity as a paradigm shift for multi-site collaborations, alleviating the need for data-sharing.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the mortality rate of breast cancer in females is rapidly increasing because of unawareness and failed to detect in earlier stages. In existing, several studies are attempted to develop a robust mechanism for detecting breast cancers from the given input samples. However, they are not as much effective because of several limitations and the secured sharing of sensitive medical images is still a challenging problem faced by medical sector. Thus, the proposed study aims to introduce an automated disease diagnosis system using federated learning and deep learning which automates and speed up the process efficiently. The five crucial steps that involved in the proposed study are image acquisition, encryption, optimal key generation, secured data storing and disease classification. Initially, the required input medical images are gathered in the image acquisition stage. Then, to afford more confidentiality, the gathered medical samples are encrypted through an Extended ElGamal Image Encryption (E-EIE) method. Here, the efficiency of encryption process is enhanced by generating the suitable keys in optimal manner with the help of Improved Sand Cat Swarm Optimization (I-SCSO) algorithm. Next, the security of encrypted images are improvised by utilizing federated learning flower (FLF) framework for storage purpose. This framework has the ability to transmit the medical images with higher security. Finally, the stored images are decrypted and performs disease classification by using convolutional capsule twin attention tuna optimal network (C2T2Net) model. The available loss in the proposed classifier is reduced by fine-tuning the parameters using chaotic tuna swarm optimization (CTSO) algorithm. For simulation analysis, the proposed study used Python software and the experimental analysis is carried out by using BreakHis Database. The simulation results shows that the proposed study obtained higher performance in terms of accuracy (95.68\%), recall (95.6\%), precision (95.66\%), F-measure (95.63\%), specificity (95.6\%) and kappa coefficient (95.26\%).},

Sentiment Analysis (SA) innovation produces phonetic comprehension according to the viewpoint of machines through the handling and investigation of immense amounts of information, which is a hot expedition passageway heading into the field of man-made reasoning, a.k.a. Artificial Intelligence (AI). To address the substance appendage from short texts, we want to investigate the further semantics of words by exploiting thoughtful Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) strategies. In this way, AI, ML, and DL procedures can control and distribute intuition introspection in these difficulties. Our recommended model, based on the DL method and the GloVe word embedding approach, learns the features using a CNN layer and then coordinates those parts into a Multi-Layered Bi-DirectionalLong-Short-Term Memory (MBiLSTM) to capture long-range embedded circumstances. The main aim of this experiment is to give an adequate answer to examine feelings and user reviews in positive and negative classifications. Our runs show that a test accuracy of 92.05\% and a validation accuracy of 93.55\% can be attained with the given model. The framework is assessed using IMDB datasets. The proposed model outflanks existing pattern models, which show that going past the substance of a tweet is valuable in opinion classification orders since it gives the classifier a deep understanding of the chore.},

Although people refer to ``the'' BLEU score, BLEU is in fact a parameterized metric whose values can vary wildly with changes to these parameters. These parameters are often not reported or are hard to find, and consequently, BLEU scores between papers cannot be directly compared. I quantify this variation, finding differences as high as 1.8 between commonly used configurations. The main culprit is different tokenization and normalization schemes applied to the reference. Pointing to the success of the parsing community, I suggest machine translation researchers settle upon the BLEU scheme used by the annual Conference on Machine Translation (WMT), which does not allow for usersupplied reference processing, and provide a new tool, SACREBLEU,1 to facilitate this.},

Federated learning resolves the previous challenges with a shared global deep learning model using a central aggregator server. At the same time, patient data remain with the local party, maintaining data anonymity and security. In this study, first, we provide a comprehensive, up-to-date review of research employing federated learning in healthcare applications. Second, we evaluate a set of recent challenges from a data-centric perspective in federated learning, such as data partitioning characteristics, data distributions, data protection mechanisms, and benchmark datasets. Finally, we point out several potential challenges and future research directions in healthcare applications.},

  abstract = {Overfitting is a common problem for computer vision applications It is a problem that when training convolution neural networks and is caused by lack of training data or network complexity. The novel sequence-dropout (SD) method is proposed in this paper to alleviate the problem of overfitting when training networks. The SD method works by dropping out units (channels of feature) from the network in a sequence, replacing the traditional operation of random omitting. Sophisticated aggregation strategies are used to obtain the global information of feature channels, and channel-wise weights are produced by gating mechanism. The SD method then selectively drops out the feature channels according to the channel-wise weights that represent the importance degree of each channel. The proposed SD block can be plugged into state-of-the-art backbone CNN models such as VGGNet and ResNet. The SD block is then evaluated on these models, demonstrating consistent performance gains over the baseline model on widely-used benchmark image classification datasets including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet2012. Experimental results demonstrate that the superior performance of the SD block compared to other modern methods.},

Model aggregation, also known as model fusion, plays a vital role in FL. It involves combining locally generated models from client devices into a single global model while maintaining user data privacy. However, the accuracy and reliability of the resulting global model depend on the aggregation method chosen, making the selection of an appropriate method crucial. Initially, the simple averaging of model weights was the most commonly used method. However, due to its limitations in handling low-quality or malicious models, alternative techniques have been explored. As FL gains popularity in various domains, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of the available model aggregation techniques and their respective strengths and limitations. However, there is currently a significant gap in the literature when it comes to systematic and comprehensive reviews of these techniques. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review encompassing 201 studies on model aggregation in FL. The focus is on summarizing the proposed techniques and the ones currently applied for model fusion. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers to enhance and develop new aggregation techniques, as well as for practitioners to select the most appropriate method for their FL applications.},

  abstract = {With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms, the landscape of data-driven medical applications has emerged as a promising avenue for designing robust and scalable diagnostic and prognostic models from medical data. This has gained a lot of attention from both academia and industry, leading to significant improvements in healthcare quality. However, the adoption of AI-driven medical applications still faces tough challenges, including meeting security, privacy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) standards. Recent developments in federated learning (FL) have made it possible to train complex machine-learned models in a distributed manner and have become an active research domain, particularly processing the medical data at the edge of the network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and address security concerns. To this end, in this article, we explore the present and future of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a significant challenge. We delve into the current research trends and their outcomes, unraveling the complexities of designing reliable and scalable FL models. This article outlines the fundamental statistical issues in FL, tackles device-related problems, addresses security challenges, and navigates the complexity of privacy concerns, all while highlighting its transformative potential in the medical field. Our study primarily focuses on medical applications of FL, particularly in the context of global cancer diagnosis. We highlight the potential of FL to enable computer-aided diagnosis tools that address this challenge with greater effectiveness than traditional data-driven methods. Recent literature has shown that FL models are robust and generalize well to new data, which is essential for medical applications. We hope that this comprehensive review will serve as a checkpoint for the field, summarizing the current state of the art and identifying open problems and future research directions.},

Thus, this study aims to diagnose tomato leaf diseases by classifying healthy and unhealthy tomato leaf images using two pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs): Inception V3 and Inception ResNet V2. The two models were trained using an open-source database (PlantVillage) and field-recorded images with a total of 5225 images. The models were investigated with dropout rates of 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 25\%, 30\%, 40\%, and 50\%. The most important results showed that the Inception V3 model with a 50\% dropout rate and the Inception ResNet V2 model with a 15\% dropout rate, as they gave the best performance with an accuracy of 99.22\% and a loss of 0.03. The high-performance rate shows the possibility of utilizing CNNs models for diagnosing tomato diseases under field and laboratory conditions. It is also an approach that can be expanded to support an integrated system for diagnosing various plant diseases.},

Additional sociotechnical challenges include items such as how to define the project goals and how to ensure the project is effectively managed. This paper reports on a set of case studies where researchers were embedded within data science teams and where the researcher observations and analysis was focused on the attributes that can help describe data science projects and the challenges faced by the teams executing these projects, as opposed to the algorithms and technologies that were used to perform the analytics. Based on our case studies, we identified 14 characteristics that can help describe a data science project.

Finally, by clustering the projects within these two dimensions, we identified four types of data science projects, and based on the type of project, we identified some of the sociotechnical challenges that project teams should expect to encounter when executing data science projects.}

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 2016, researchers have applied the idea of Federated Learning (FL) to several domains ranging from edge computing to banking. The technique's inherent security benefits, privacy-preserving capabilities, ease of scalability, and ability to transcend data biases have motivated researchers to use this tool on healthcare datasets. While several reviews exist detailing FL and its applications, this review focuses solely on the different applications of FL to medical imaging datasets, grouping applications by diseases, modality, and/or part of the body. This Systematic Literature review was conducted by querying and consolidating results from ArXiv, IEEE Xplorer, and PubMed. Furthermore, we provide a detailed description of FL architecture, models, descriptions of the performance achieved by FL models, and how results compare with traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Additionally, we discuss the security benefits, highlighting two primary forms of privacy-preserving techniques, including homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. Finally, we provide some background information and context regarding where the contributions lie. The background information is organized into the following categories: architecture/setup type, data-related topics, security, and learning types. While progress has been made within the field of FL and medical imaging, much room for improvement and understanding remains, with an emphasis on security and data issues remaining the primary concerns for researchers. Therefore, improvements are constantly pushing the field forward. Finally, we highlighted the challenges in deploying FL in medical imaging applications and provided recommendations for future directions.},

Like ResNet and EfficientNet, many architectures have achieved outstanding results in at least one dataset by the time of their creation. A critical factor in training concerns the network's regularization, which prevents the structure from overfitting. This work analyzes several regularization methods developed in the past few years, showing significant improvements for different CNN models. The works are classified into three main areas: the first one is called ``data augmentation,'' where all the techniques focus on performing changes in the input data. The second, named ``internal changes,'' aims to describe procedures to modify the feature maps generated by the neural network or the kernels. The last one, called ``label,'' concerns transforming the labels of a given input. This work presents two main differences comparing to other available surveys about regularization: (i) the first concerns the papers gathered in the manuscript, which are not older than five years, and (ii) the second distinction is about reproducibility, i.e., all works referred here have their code available in public repositories or they have been directly implemented in some framework, such as TensorFlow or Torch.},

Here I focus on the history of modern artificial intelligence (AI) which is dominated by artificial neural networks (NNs) and deep learning, both conceptually closer to the old field of cybernetics than to what's been called AI since 1956 (e.g., expert systems and logic programming). A modern history of AI will emphasize breakthroughs outside of the focus of traditional AI text books, in particular, mathematical foundations of today's NNs such as the chain rule (1676), the first NNs (linear regression, circa 1800), and the first working deep learners (1965-). From the perspective of 2022, I provide a timeline of the -- in hindsight -- most important relevant events in the history of NNs, deep learning, AI, computer science, and mathematics in general, crediting those who laid foundations of the field.

  abstract = {While the application of machine-learning algorithms has been highly simplified in the last years due to their well-documented integration in commonly used statistical programming languages (such as R or Python), there are several practical challenges in the field of ecological modeling related to unbiased performance estimation. One is the influence of spatial autocorrelation in both hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation. Grouped cross-validation strategies have been proposed in recent years in environmental as well as medical contexts to reduce bias in predictive performance. In this study we show the effects of spatial autocorrelation on hyperparameter tuning and performance estimation by comparing several widely used machine-learning algorithms such as boosted regression trees (BRT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) with traditional parametric algorithms such as logistic regression (GLM) and semi-parametric ones like generalized additive models (GAM) in terms of predictive performance. Spatial and non-spatial cross-validation methods were used to evaluate model performances aiming to obtain bias-reduced performance estimates. A detailed analysis on the sensitivity of hyperparameter tuning when using different resampling methods (spatial/non-spatial) was performed. As a case study the spatial distribution of forest disease (Diplodia sapinea) in the Basque Country (Spain) was investigated using common environmental variables such as temperature, precipitation, soil and lithology as predictors. Random Forest (mean Brier score estimate of 0.166) outperformed all other methods with regard to predictive accuracy. Though the sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning differed between the ML algorithms, there were in most cases no substantial differences between spatial and non-spatial partitioning for hyperparameter tuning. However, spatial hyperparameter tuning maintains consistency with spatial estimation of classifier performance and should be favored over non-spatial hyperparameter optimization. High performance differences (up to 47\%) between the bias-reduced (spatial cross-validation) and overoptimistic (non-spatial cross-validation) cross-validation settings showed the high need to account for the influence of spatial autocorrelation. Overoptimistic performance estimates may lead to false actions in ecological decision making based on biased model predictions.},

The effectiveness of real-time image captioning is a severe barrier that prevents its use in sensitive applications such as visual aid, security, and medicine. Another observation from our research is the scarcity of personalized domain datasets that limits its adoption into more advanced issues.

Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99\% of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine.},

Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

Recent strides in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have primarily harnessed imaging techniques like CT, X-rays, PET, and MRI for cancer detection. Concurrently, the rapidly growing volume of genomic big data presents an untapped reservoir for identifying genetic mutations characteristic of STAD. Our research explores this avenue by examining gene amino acid sequences altered by STAD. We employ physical properties of amino acids, i.e., Electro-Ion Interaction Pseudopotential (EIIP) values and Kidera factors in feature extraction, a novel strategy in STAD diagnostics. To address the issue of class imbalance, we incorporate generative AI to produce additional data samples. Addressing the privacy and security challenges associated with data centralization in healthcare, we propose Fed\_ANN11, an artificial neural network (ANN) model developed in a federated environment following an initial deployment as ANN11. Our model demonstrates remarkable accuracy in both simple and federated environments with extracted feature sets, namely, EIIP-based and Kidera factors-based. We found that EIIP-based features eclipse Kidera factors in performance. In a simple setting, the proposed model achieved a testing accuracy of 86\% and a training accuracy of 88\% for STAD detection using the EIIP-based feature set. In a federated environment, it achieved an accuracy of 0.94\% in testing and 0.99\% in training for STAD detection using the EIIP-based feature set. Moreover, our proposed model shows significant performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Fed\_ANN11 not only excels in diagnostic precision but also upholds stringent big data security and privacy protocols, heralding a paradigm shift in AI's role in healthcare.},

This work implements a generative CNN-LSTM model that beats human baselines by 2.7 BLEU-4 points and is close to matching (3.8 CIDEr points lower) the current state of the art. Experiments on the MSCOCO dataset set shows that it generates sensible and accurate captions in a majority of cases, and hyperparameter tuning using dropout and number of LSTM layers allow us to alleviate the effects of overfitting. We also demonstrate that semantically-close emitted words (e.g. 'plate' and 'bowl') move the LSTM hidden state in similar ways despite differing previous contexts, and that divergences in hidden state occur only upon emission of semantically-distant words (e.g. 'vase' and 'food'). This gives semantic meaning to the interaction between learned word embeddings and the LSTM hidden states. To our knowledge, this is a novel contribution to the literature.}

  abstract = {Deep learning-based medical image analysis is an effective and precise method for identifying various cancer types. However, due to concerns over patient privacy, sharing diagnostic images across medical facilities is typically not permitted. Federated learning (FL) tries to construct a shared model across dispersed clients under such privacy-preserving constraints. Although there is a good chance of success, dealing with non-IID (non-independent and identical distribution) client data, which is a typical circumstance in real-world FL tasks, is still difficult for FL. We use two FL algorithms, FedAvg and FedProx, to manage client heterogeneity and non-IID data in a federated setting. A heterogeneous data split of the cancer datasets with three different forms of cancer---cervical, lung, and colon---is used to validate the efficacy of the FL.

  abstract = {Deep learning-based medical image analysis is an effective and precise method for identifying various cancer types. However, due to concerns over patient privacy, sharing diagnostic images across medical facilities is typically not permitted. Federated learning (FL) tries to construct a shared model across dispersed clients under such privacy-preserving constraints. Although there is a good chance of success, dealing with non-IID (non-independent and identical distribution) client data, which is a typical circumstance in real-world FL tasks, is still difficult for FL. We use two FL algorithms, FedAvg and FedProx, to manage client heterogeneity and non-IID data in a federated setting. A heterogeneous data split of the cancer datasets with three different forms of cancer---cervical, lung, and colon---is used to validate the efficacy of the FL. In addition, since hyperparameter optimization presents new difficulties in an FL setting, we also examine the impact of various hyperparameter values. We use Bayesian optimization to fine-tune the hyperparameters and identify the appropriate values in order to increase performance. Furthermore, we investigate the hyperparameter optimization in both local and global models of the FL environment.

  abstract = {Recent improvements in marine science research have increased the importance of underwater fish species identification. Using technology to automate fish species identification would positively impact marine biology. Since deep learning techniques, image classification problems have become increasingly popular. Wild natural habitats make it harder to identify fish species because of the complex background and noise in the raw images. Some of the most advanced approaches for categorizing fish species in their natural habitats have been developed in the previous decade. This paper demonstrated an automated approach for classifying fish species based on deep residual networks. Existing transfer learning models do a good job working with smaller datasets, but not so effectively. A novel RESNET model (SmallerRESNET) is developed to reduce the overfitting generated by the standard pre-trained RESNET model. Convolutional and fully linked layers are used in the more straightforward form of the RESNET model. We evaluated and compared six different versions of the RESNET model. In addition to the number of convolutional and fully connected layers, the number of iterations required to achieve 80.56\% accuracy on training data, batch size, and the dropout layer is examined. Compared to the original RESNET model, the proposed and modified RESNET model with fewer layers obtained 90.26\% testing accuracy with a validation loss of 0.0916 on an untrained benchmark fish dataset. The inclusion of a dropout layer enhanced our proposed model's overall performance. It is more efficient with less memory, fewer training photos, and less computing complexity than its predecessor.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10{\texttimes} or 100{\texttimes}? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pretraining) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-theart results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

  abstract = {Peritoneal carcinomatosis, which is the most common malignant process of the peritoneal cavity, originates mostly from colorectal, gastric, and gynaecological malignancies. The differential diagnosis is broad and covers primary peritoneal malignancies, as well as many benign disorders such as endometriosis, and inflammatory and infectious diseases. Peritoneal implants tend to locate in the areas of the physiological stasis of the peritoneal fluid: pelvic peritoneal reflections, right and left paracolic gutters, superior part of the sigmoid mesocolon, ileocolic area, and the right subdiaphragmatic space. The 3 most common imaging findings are ascites, nodular implants, and infiltration of the peritoneal fatty tissue. Several imaging modalities may be applied in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Ultrasound has low sensitivity and specificity, and therefore plays only a marginal role. Computed tomography is the method of choice, due to its availability, cost-effectiveness, and relatively high sensitivity. The sensitivity of magnetic resonance imaging depends on the size of peritoneal implants -- in cases of implants larger than 10 mm is comparable to CT. Some studies suggest that PET/CT may be the most sensitive method, yet its usefulness in everyday practice is controversial. The Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Index (PCI) is a scale used to assess the tumour burden in the peritoneum and may serve as a communication tool between clinicians and radiologists. The imaging findings may influence the surgeon's decision on performing cytoreductive surgery, which may be followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC or EPIC procedures). The introduction of these therapeutic methods has significantly improved the life expectancy of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis.},

  abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows decentralized clients to learn collaboratively without sharing their private data. However, excessive computation and communication demands pose challenges to current FL frameworks, especially when training large-scale models. To prevent these issues from hindering the deployment of FL systems, we propose a lightweight framework where clients jointly learn to fuse the representations generated by multiple fixed pre-trained models rather than training a large-scale model from scratch. This leads us to a more practical FL problem by considering how to capture more client-specific and class-relevant information from the pre-trained models and jointly improve each client's ability to exploit those off-the-shelf models. In this work, we design a Federated Prototype-wise Contrastive Learning (FedPCL) approach which shares knowledge across clients through their class prototypes and builds client-specific representations in a prototype-wise contrastive manner. Sharing prototypes rather than learnable model parameters allows each client to fuse the representations in a personalized way while keeping the shared knowledge in a compact form for efficient communication. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed FedPCL in the lightweight framework, measuring and visualizing its ability to fuse various pre-trained models on popular FL datasets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aimed to develop and validate a real-time deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) system for detecting early gastric cancer (EGC). METHODS: All 45,240 endoscopic images from 1364 patients were divided into a training dataset (35823 images from 1085 patients) and a validation dataset (9417 images from 279 patients). Another 1514 images from three other hospitals were used as external validation. We compared the diagnostic performance of the DCNN system with endoscopists, and then evaluated the performance of endoscopists with or without referring to the system. Thereafter, we evaluated the diagnostic ability of the DCNN system in video streams. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and Cohen's kappa coefficient were measured to assess the detection performance. FINDING: The DCNN system showed good performance in EGC detection in validation datasets, with accuracy (85.1\%-91.2\%), sensitivity (85.9\%-95.5\%), specificity (81.7\%-90.3\%), and AUC (0.887-0.940). The DCNN system showed better diagnostic performance than endoscopists and improved the performance of endoscopists. The DCNN system was able to process oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) video streams to detect EGC lesions in real time. INTERPRETATION: We developed a real-time DCNN system for EGC detection with high accuracy and stability. Multicentre prospective validation is needed to acquire high-level evidence for its clinical application.

  abstract = {Designing convolutional neural networks (CNN) for mobile devices is challenging because mobile models need to be small and fast, yet still accurate. Although significant efforts have been dedicated to design and improve mobile CNNs on all dimensions, it is very difficult to manually balance these trade-offs when there are so many architectural possibilities to consider. In this paper, we propose an automated mobile neural architecture search (MNAS) approach, which explicitly incorporate model latency into the main objective so that the search can identify a model that achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and latency. Unlike previous work, where latency is considered via another, often inaccurate proxy (e.g., FLOPS), our approach directly measures real-world inference latency by executing the model on mobile phones. To further strike the right balance between flexibility and search space size, we propose a novel factorized hierarchical search space that encourages layer diversity throughout the network. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art mobile CNN models across multiple vision tasks. On the ImageNet classification task, our MnasNet achieves 75.2\% top-1 accuracy with 78ms latency on a Pixel phone, which is 1.8x faster than MobileNetV2 [29] with 0.5\% higher accuracy and 2.3x faster than NASNet [36] with 1.2\% higher accuracy. Our MnasNet also achieves better mAP quality than MobileNets for COCO object detection. Code is at https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mnasnet},

However, most new research has only been conducted in centralized learning (CL) environments, which entails the risk of privacy breaches. Moreover, the accurate identification and localization of lesions and tumor prediction using AI technologies is expected to increase patients' likelihood of survival. To address these difficulties, we developed a federated learning (FL) facility that extracts features from participating environments rather than a CL facility. This study's novel contributions include (i) the application of transfer learning to extract data features from the region of interest (ROI) in an image, which aims to enable careful pre-processing and data enhancement for data training purposes; (ii) the use of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to process data, which aims to more uniformly classify data and improve diagnostic prediction performance for diseases; (iii) the application of FeAvg-CNN + MobileNet in an FL framework to ensure customer privacy and personal security; and (iv) the presentation of experimental results from different deep learning, transfer learning and FL models with balanced and imbalanced mammography datasets, which demonstrate that our solution leads to much higher classification performance than other approaches and is viable for use in AI healthcare applications.},

However deep neural networks usually use lots of parameters and suffer from overfitting. Dropout is a widely use method to deal with overfitting. Although dropout can significantly regularize fully connected layers in neural networks, it usually leads to suboptimal results when used for convolutional layers. To tackle this problem, we propose DropFilter, a dropout method for convolutional layers. DropFilter considers the filters rather than the neural units as the basic data drop units. Because it is observed that co-adaptations are more likely to occur inter rather than intra filters in convolutional layers. Using DropFilter, we remarkably improve the performance of convolutional networks on CIFAR and ImageNet.},

As project managers, we are helping our companies survive in this difficult landscape. We are "agents of change" and "drivers of change." The most important project management methodology today that will help us deal with this change and this volatility is Agile. However, no one process or project management methodology fits all situations! Agile is not a panacea for all projects. Many times, our projects are large enough and complex enough that some parts of the project are best suited to using a predictive planning approach, and other parts are more suited to using Agile. Therefore, a hybrid approach that mixes the traditional, waterfall approach with Agile is really required in many situations today. The agile community oftentimes has quite a negative view of hybrid approaches. Key writers on Agile often say that attempting to use hybrid will corrupt all attempts to use Agile, and will result in failure. In this book, the argument is made that integrating these methodologies can be done if approached the right way, and in fact, this is necessary today.},

  abstract = {Image captioning is an interesting and challenging task with applications in diverse domains such as image retrieval, organizing and locating images of users' interest, etc. It has huge potential for replacing manual caption generation for images and is especially suitable for large-scale image data. Recently, deep neural network based methods have achieved great success in the field of computer vision, machine translation, and language generation. In this paper, we propose an encoder-decoder based model that is capable of generating grammatically correct captions for images. This model makes use of VGG16 Hybrid Places 1365 as an encoder and LSTM as a decoder. To ensure the complete ground truth accuracy, the model is trained on the labeled Flickr8k and MS-COCO Captions datasets., Further, the model is evaluated using all popular standard metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, GLEU, and ROUGE\_L. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model obtained a BLEU-1 score of 0.6666, METEOR score of 0.5060, and GLEU score of 0.2469 on the Flickr8k dataset and BLEU-1 score 0.7350, METEOR score of 0.4768 and GLEU score 0.2798 on MS-COCO Caption dataset. Thus, the proposed method achieved a significant performance as compared to the state-of-art approaches. To evaluate the efficacy of the model further, we also show the results of caption generation from live sample images that reinforce the validity of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {In medical imaging, segmentation plays a vital role towards the interpretation of X-ray images where salient features are extracted with the help of image segmentation. Without undergoing surgery, clinicians employ various modalities ranging from X-rays and CT-Scans to ultrasonography, and other imaging techniques to visualise and examine interior human body organ and structures. To ensure appropriate convergence, training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch is tough since it requires more computational time, a big amount of labelled training data and a considerable degree of experience. Fine-tuning a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a huge set of labelled medical datasets, is a viable alternative. In this paper, a comparative study was done using pre-trained models such as VGG-19 and ResNet-50 as against training from scratch. To reduce overfitting, data augmentation and dropout regularization was used. With a recall of 92.03\%, our analysis showed that the pre-trained models with proper finetuning was comparable with Iyke-Net, a CNN trained from scratch.},

  abstract = {Purpose Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an ever-increasing role in Neuroradiology. Methods When designing AI-based research in neuroradiology and appreciating the literature, it is important to understand the fundamental principles of AI. Training, validation, and test datasets must be defined and set apart as priorities. External validation and testing datasets are preferable, when feasible. The specific type of learning process (supervised vs. unsupervised) and the machine learning model also require definition. Deep learning (DL) is an AI-based approach that is modelled on the structure of neurons of the brain; convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a commonly used example in neuroradiology. Results Radiomics is a frequently used approach in which a multitude of imaging features are extracted from a region of interest and subsequently reduced and selected to convey diagnostic or prognostic information. Deep radiomics uses CNNs to directly extract features and obviate the need for predefined features. Conclusion Common limitations and pitfalls in AI-based research in neuroradiology are limited sample sizes (``small-n-large-p problem''), selection bias, as well as overfitting and underfitting.},

Previous studies focused on three areas, i.e., designing propagation models, improving seed-node selection algorithms and exploiting the structure of social networks. However, most of these studies ignored the time constraint in influence propagation. Here, I studied how to maximize the speed of influence propagation. I extended the classic Independent Cascade model to a Continuous Dynamic Extended Independent Cascade (CDEIC) model. In addition, I proposed a novel heuristic algorithm and evaluated the algorithm using two large academic collaboration data sets. The new algorithm is 10\%-20\% faster in influence propagation than previous classic heuristic algorithms on the CDE-IC model. Furthermore, I gave solutions to calculate propagation probability between adjacent nodes by exploiting the structure of social network.},

  abstract = {Deep learning-based methods have achieved encouraging performances in the field of Magnetic Resonance (MR) image reconstruction. Nevertheless, building powerful and robust deep learning models requires collecting large and diverse datasets from multiple centers. This raises concerns about ethics and data privacy. Recently, federated learning has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the utilization of multi-center data without the need for data transfer between institutions. Despite its potential, existing federated learning methods face challenges due to the high heterogeneity of data from different centers. Aggregation methods based on simple averaging, which are commonly used to combine the client's information, have shown limited reconstruction and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Model-based Federated learning framework (ModFed) to address these challenges. ModFed has three major contributions: (1) Different from existing data-driven federated learning methods, ModFed designs attention-assisted model-based neural networks that can alleviate the need for large amounts of data on each client; (2) To address the data heterogeneity issue, ModFed proposes an adaptive dynamic aggregation scheme, which can improve the generalization capability and robustness of the trained neural network models; (3) ModFed incorporates a spatial Laplacian attention mechanism and a personalized client-side loss regularization to capture the detailed information for accurate image reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed ModFed is evaluated on three in-vivo datasets. Experimental results show that when compared to six existing state-of-the-art federated learning approaches, ModFed achieves better MR image reconstruction performance with increased generalization capability. Codes will be made available at https://github.com/ternencewu123/ModFed.},

Results Based on preliminary testing experience and with subsequent technical and system improvements, we then proceeded to perform two cases of cholecystectomy and were able to achieve clinical success with an 8K UHD endoscopic system, which consisted of an 8K camera, a 30-degrees angled rigid endoscope with a lens adapter, a pair of 300-W xenon light sources, an 85-inch 8K LCD and an 8K video recorder. These experimental and clinical studies revealed the engineering and clinical feasibility of the 8K UHD endoscope, enabling us to have a positive outlook on its prospective use in clinical practice. Conclusions The 8K UHD endoscopy promises to open up new possibilities for intricate procedures including anastomoses of thin nerves and blood vessels as well as more confident surgical resections of a diversity of cancer tissues. 8K endoscopic imaging, compared to imaging by the current 2K imaging technology, is very likely to lead to major changes in the future of medical practice.},

Histopathological image analysis (HIA) is the gold standard for this purpose but it is time-consuming and laborious, leading to interest in computer-aided diagnosis to assist pathologists. Deep learning has shown promise in various HIA tasks, but the limited amount of training data in medical imaging has posed a significant obstacle. In this paper, we propose transfer learning-based CNNs for binary classification of gastric cancer patches, overcoming this limitation. We validate our approach on the publicly available GasHisSDB dataset, which includes three sub-databases with patch sizes of 80 x 80 pixels, 120 x 120 pixels, and 160 x 160 pixels. Our experimental results show that the DenseNet121 model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.68 \% and AUC of 98.58\% on the 160-pixels sub-database. These results suggest that our proposed work can assist pathologists in the detection of gastric cancer through histopathological image analysis.},

Then, we present an overview of the use of CNNs, for image classification, segmentation, detection, and other tasks such as registration, content-based image retrieval, image generation and enhancement, in some typical medical diagnosis areas such as brain, breast, and abdominal. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges of CNNs in medical image analysis, and accordingly we present some ideas for future research directions.},

  abstract = {Regional dropout strategies have been proposed to enhance the performance of convolutional neural network classifiers. They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout remove informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not desirable because it leads to information loss and inefficiency during training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on the ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gains in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix improves the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of-distribution detection performances.

In this work, we propose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In essence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of examples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to favor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on the ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show that mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network architectures. We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt labels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the training of generative adversarial networks.},

  abstract = {One-shot Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising approach, which allows the central server to learn a model in a single communication round. Despite the low communication cost, existing one-shot FL methods are mostly impractical or face inherent limitations, e.g., a public dataset is required, clients' models are homogeneous, need to upload additional data/model information. To overcome these issues, we propose a more practical data-free approach named FedSyn for one-shot FL framework with heterogeneity. Our FedSyn trains the global model by a data generation stage and a model distillation stage. To the best of our knowledge, FedSyn is the first method that can be practically applied to various real-world applications due to the following advantages: (1) FedSyn requires no additional information (except the model parameters) to be transferred between clients and the server; (2) FedSyn does not require any auxiliary dataset for training; (3) FedSyn is the first to consider both model and statistical heterogeneities in FL, i.e., the clients' data are non-iid and different clients may have different model architectures. Experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our FedSyn. For example, FedSyn outperforms the best baseline method Fed-ADI by 5.08\% on CIFAR10 dataset when data are non-iid.},

  abstract = {Distributed training can facilitate the processing of large medical image datasets, and improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease diagnosis while protecting patient privacy, which is crucial for achieving efficient medical image analysis and accelerating medical research progress. This paper presents an innovative approach to medical image classification, leveraging Federated Learning (FL) to address the dual challenges of data privacy and efficient disease diagnosis. Traditional Centralized Machine Learning models, despite their widespread use in medical imaging for tasks such as disease diagnosis, raise significant privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of patient data. As an alternative, FL emerges as a promising solution by allowing the training of a collective global model across local clients without centralizing the data, thus preserving privacy. Focusing on the application of FL in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain tumor detection, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the Federated Learning framework coupled with EfficientNet-B0 and the FedAvg algorithm in enhancing both privacy and diagnostic accuracy. Through a meticulous selection of preprocessing methods, algorithms, and hyperparameters, and a comparative analysis of various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, the research uncovers optimal strategies for image classification. The experimental results reveal that EfficientNet-B0 outperforms other models like ResNet in handling data heterogeneity and achieving higher accuracy and lower loss, highlighting the potential of FL in overcoming the limitations of traditional models. The study underscores the significance of addressing data heterogeneity and proposes further research directions for broadening the applicability of FL in medical image analysis.},

  abstract = {Developing neural network image classification models often requires significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we study a method to learn the model architectures directly on the dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large, we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and then transfer the block to a larger dataset. The key contribution of this work is the design of a new search space (which we call the ``NASNet search space'') which enables transferability. In our experiments, we search for the best convolutional layer (or ``cell'') on the CIFAR-10 dataset and then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies of this cell, each with their own parameters to design a convolutional architecture, which we name a ``NASNet architecture''. We also introduce a new regularization technique called ScheduledDropPath that significantly improves generalization in the NASNet models. On CIFAR-10 itself, a NASNet found by our method achieves 2.4\% error rate, which is state-of-the-art. Although the cell is not searched for directly on ImageNet, a NASNet constructed from the best cell achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7\% top-1 and 96.2\% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2\% better in top-1 accuracy than the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS -- a reduction of 28\% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of NASNets exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For instance, a small version of NASNet also achieves 74\% top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1\% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art models for mobile platforms. Finally, the image features learned from image classification are generically useful and can be transferred to other computer vision problems. On the task of object detection, the learned features by NASNet used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0\% achieving 43.1\% mAP on the COCO dataset.},
